# RICHPANELPROJECT
My attempt at the task assigned to us is now live at https://richpanelproject.vercel.app

Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
React JS
FIREBASE
EXPRESS JS
Vercel frontend hosting
AWS EC2 server hosting for Stripe request

I had a ton of fun working on this webapp and it was a pleasantly challenging experience. The source code for the project can be found at https://github.com/AyushRoberts/RICHPANELPROJECT

Although there are a few known bugs related to session management, I tried my best to replicate the design and fundamental working of the webapp and database connectivity as quickly as possible

The video demo and working of the project can be found at https://youtu.be/2QRZanGsjX4

I had some trouble setting up https with AWS, so please do the follwing

Open https://richpanelproject.vercel.app
Click on the lock icon on url bar
Go to site settings
Look for 'Insecure Content'
Allow it

This is needed to fetch Steipe client secret that my server fetches from Stripe API on the AWS
You cannot successfully subscribe to plans on https

Hoping to receive a feedback soon
